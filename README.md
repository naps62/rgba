# RGB - a Rust Game Boy Emulator

## Resources

This is a list of most resources I used to find out more about the hardware
architecture and emulation requirements for a Game Boy. Most of these were
taken from the [Awesome Game Boy Development] list.

1. [Ultimate Game Boy Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyzD8pNlpwI): a talk dissecting the internals of a Game Boy's
   hardware;
2. [Game Boy: Complete Technical Reference](https://gekkio.fi/files/gb-docs/gbctr.pdf): exactly what the name suggests it is;
